<sup>REDmodding mod repository.</sup>

filmic (stylized as FILMIC) is a film emulation suite for Cyberpunk 2077,
including both gameplay film emulation based off motion picture film and more
opinionated print films, and photomode-focused film emulation that simulates
popular color negative films with a neutral print film.

## Overview

filmic is an extensive and accurate film emulation suite for Cyberpunk. Designed
to weigh in historical accuracy whenever possible, it includes an overhauled
photo mode filter system; included to make the photo mode experience more
similar to film cameras.

filmic is made by **[xtaltha]**, a REDmodding organization.

It is made by using a combination of the Realcolorr LUT generation process,
which employs ACES; as well as the film emulation plugin for DaVinci Resolve
Dehancer: a trusted film emulation plugin used by many professionals.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of Cyberpunk's as-of-yet unalterable shaders,
it is not possible to implement many film effects, like halation, accurate
bloom, accurate grain, gate weave, motion blur, spectral chromatic aberration,
etc.

## Installation

You can find the most up-to-date, possibly unstable, versions under the
_Actions_ header at the top of the GitHub UI and download the _mod_ artifact. To
get release versions, you can also find them under _releases_ on the right of
the GitHub UI.

The _mod_ artifacts are packed with a traditional packing style (e.g.
`/archive/pc/mod/`), while releases should provide a REDmod **and** traditional
version.

## Building

To build defacto, you just need to open the defacto.cpmodproj file in
**[WolvenKit]** and install it as a REDmod or as a traditional mod.
**[WolvenKit]** should take care of the rest.

If it doesn't work, please open an issue in the _Issues_ tab&mdash;as well as if
you can detect any invalid stuff in the source.
